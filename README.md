# TestRobotFramework

Introduction
Welcome to the prototipe TestRoboFramework.

Getting Started
Dependency’s
First of all you need to check our guide down below:

Installing Python
Open the terminal
Run the command python3 --version to check if Python is installed on your OS
If it was installed just continue to next step if it is not you need Install Python 
Run the command pip3 --version and check if pip is installed on your system.
In Linux, sometimes, you need to install pip3, if you run the command above (Step 4) and don't show the pip3 version just do the step bellow, if it returns the pip3 version just go to step 8
If python wasn't installed on your OS install by the command sudo apt install python3-pip
Once finished the python installation run the command pip3 --versionand check that it is installed something like this: `pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)
At the end just run the command sudo apt update to update your repository index and the process is done
Installing Robot Framework
Open the terminal
Run the command sudo pip3 install robotframework to install robot
Run the command robot --version to check the installation

After that we need to repeat the install command for the library's:
robotframework-appiumlibrary
robotframework-jsonlibrary
robotframework-pythonlibcore
robotframework-requests
robotframework-seleniumlibrary
robotframework-sshlibrary
After we can check everything installed with the command pip3 list

We recommend you to use the VS Code IDE to code your automation but you can use others. To install VS Code use This Link 
We recommend those plugins: Robot Framework Intellisense Robot Framework Intellisense FORK Robot Extension Hyper Term Theme
